# TerraformDev

## Setup

Examples and scripts that I put together here as I go through the process of learning Terraform.

The starting point for this example was my [Basic Resource Group Example](../BasicRG/) and the [Terraform App Service documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/2.1.0/docs/resources/app_service)

This current version will create

- a resource group called "tfBasicWebAppRGDev"
- a WebAppService Plan using the F1 free tier called "tfBasicWebAppPlanDev"
- an App Service called "tfBasicWebAppServiceDev"
